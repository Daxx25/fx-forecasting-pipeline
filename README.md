# FX Forecasting Pipeline

An end-to-end automated data pipeline to forecast foreign exchange (FX) currency pair movements using regression and classification models. This project leverages real-time market data, macroeconomic indicators, and lightweight AutoML to deliver directional predictions.

## üîç Overview

This project focuses on predicting FX currency pair movements using:
- Regression models for base pairs (e.g., EUR/USD)
- Classification models for synthetic pairs
- Macroeconomic feature engineering, including BTC correlation

The pipeline is orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**, stores time-series data with **ArcticDB**, and uses **PyCaret** for fast, modular model training.
